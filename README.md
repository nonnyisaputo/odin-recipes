# odin-recipes

This is my first project for The Odin Project.

The assignment is to create a basic website which consists of a main index page, which will have links to a few recipes. This project will be revisited in the future in order to style it using CSS.

## TODO:

Iteration 1: Initial Structure

- [X] Create index.html file in the odin-recipes directory
- [X] Add boilerplate HTML
- [X] Add h1 heading "Odin Recipes" to the body

***Completed 7/12/2022 @ 9:15AM***

Iteration 2: Recipe Page

- [ ] Create new directory odin-recipes/recipes
- [ ] Create new HTML file within recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain
- [ ] Add h1 heading with the recipe's name
- [ ] Add link to recipe page in index.html, link should be the recipe name.

Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

- [ ] Image of finished dish under the h1
- [ ] Add appropriately sized "Description" heading
- [ ] Add paragraph or two describing the recipe
- [ ] Under description, add "Ingredients" heading
  - [ ] Add unordered list of the ingredients
- [ ] Under ingredients, add "Steps" heading
  - [ ] Add ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish

Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
- [ ] Add two more recipes to recipe page with identical page structures
- [ ] Link to new recipes on index page
- [ ] Put all links in an unordered list so they aren't all on one line.
